# Deadpool's Healing Factor

Deadpool can't stay dead and now your colonists don't have to either. This mod is a lightweight patch built on top of the **Immortals** framework to give pawns an overpowered regenerative ability.

## Features

- Replaces the Immortals hediff with **Healing Factor**, complete with new flavour text.
- Removes beheading, impaling and extractor designators so you can focus on regeneration rather than decapitation.
- Sets the healing factor's pain to zero for that authentic Deadpool experience.
- Tweaks revival thoughts and mood effects to match the theme.

Simply install this mod alongside its dependency **Harmony**. No configuration is required; any pawn granted the Immortal hediff will instead benefit from Deadpool's Healing Factor and rapidly recover from almost any wound.
