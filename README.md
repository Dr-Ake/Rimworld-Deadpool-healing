# Deadpool's Healing Factor

Whoa there, reader! Yep, it's me, narrating my own README. This repo packs my not-so-secret sauce straight into your RimWorld pawns. Install it and watch them shrug off decapitations faster than you can yell "Chimichanga!" No sprawling frameworks, no mystical X-Men tie-ins – just an absurd dose of regeneration wrapped in a tidy mod.

## What's in the box?

- **About/** – Metadata and a spiffy preview image so you know what you just downloaded.
- **1.6/** – All the juicy stuff for RimWorld 1.6: patch files and XML defs that keep the carnage running smoothly.
  - **Defs/** – Damage, hediff, and thought definitions that teach your pawns to ignore minor annoyances like death.
  - **Patches/** – Tiny tweaks for compatibility. I even care about lactation, apparently.
- **Languages/** – Snarky English translations. Other languages? Maybe later when I hire a bilingual merc.
That's it. No leftover `Source` folder, no uncompiled mess. Just what you see here.

## Features

- Grants a beefy healing factor that laughs at wounds and disease.
- Settings galore: tweak healing ticks, regrowth speed, and more – all described in the most sarcastic tooltips you'll ever read.
- Custom thoughts and hediffs from `Hediffs_Deadpool.xml`, including your very own Death Nap and Uncanny Hunger.
- Precompiled DLLs so you can jump straight into the action without building a thing.

## Installation

1. Grab [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/HarmonyRimWorld) if you don't already have it.
2. Drop this folder into your RimWorld `Mods` directory.
3. Fire up the game and enable **Deadpool's Healing Factor**. Boom – your colonists just went full mutant.

## Compatibility

Built for RimWorld 1.6.

## Building

You won't find the original C# source here (shhh, trade secret). The included DLL is ready to roll, so just plug it in and enjoy.

Now quit reading this file and go break the fourth wall somewhere else. Chimichangas await!
