# Deadpool's Healing Factor

Hey, comic nerds! Wade Wilson here, talking straight out of the panels to make sure you know what this mod does. Drop it into RimWorld and your pawns will regenerate limbs, organs, and maybe their sense of humor. No big crossovers or movie catchphrases, just pure comic-book weirdness.

## What's in the box?

- **About/** – Metadata and a preview image to prove this thing exists.
- **1.6/** – Everything RimWorld 1.6 needs: ready-to-go DLLs, patch files, and definitions.
  - **Assemblies/** – `Deadpool.dll` and buddies. Nothing to compile here.
  - **Defs/** – All the `DamageDefs`, `HediffDefs`, and `ThoughtDefs` that keep your colonists from staying dead.
  - **Patches/** – Tiny compatibility tweaks. Even lactation gets a nod.
- **Languages/** – English snark for now. Other tongues when I'm bored enough to learn them.
- **Textures/** – Icons for beheading, impalement, and other wholesome activities.

That's it—no secret `Source` folder, no messy build leftovers. What you see is what you get.

## Features

- A healing factor that laughs off wounds, disease, and dismemberment.
- Custom thoughts like **Death Nap** and **Uncanny Hunger** so your pawns react properly to their new powers.
- Adjustable settings for tick rates, regrowth speed, and more. Because customization is the spice of ~life~ undeath.
- Precompiled assemblies for quick setup. Drop them in and watch the carnage.

## Installation

1. Grab [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/HarmonyRimWorld) if it isn't already in your mod lineup.
2. Copy this folder into your RimWorld `Mods` directory.
3. Enable **Deadpool's Healing Factor** in-game and start slicing.

## Compatibility

Built with RimWorld 1.6 in mind, but it'll happily party with versions 1.0 through 1.5 too. Stick to the `1.6/` goodies for the latest features.

## Building

The source code's hidden away like an Easter egg, so just use the included DLLs and pretend you didn't want to tinker.

Now stop reading and go play. I'll be over here breaking the fourth wall in peace.
