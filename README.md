# Deadpool Immortals

## Features
- Brings Deadpool-inspired immortality to RimWorld.
- Allows colonists to survive normally fatal injuries, similar to the original **Immortals** mod.
- Adds beheading and impaling designators for a comic twist.

## Installation
1. Download or clone this repository into your RimWorld `Mods` directory.
2. Make sure the **Immortals** mod is installed.
3. Load the mods in the following order:
   1. **Harmony**
   2. **Immortals**
   3. **Deadpool Immortals** (this mod)

## Dependencies
- [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) – required by the original Immortals mod.
- **Immortals** – this mod patches and extends its functionality.

## Relation to Immortals
This project builds on fridgeBaron’s **Immortals** mod. It uses the same core mechanics but injects a Deadpool theme, letting your pawns regenerate like the infamous mercenary. Load it after **Immortals** to ensure all patches apply correctly.
